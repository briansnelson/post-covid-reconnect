            Is it the water that calms you? Ski, boat, paddleboard, scuba, fish, or watch the whales? If this is you, we have a perfect package to fit your needs.

            Nature smature! I want to be in the city! Sports, dining, nightlife, shopping. If you're more of a Howard Roark than an Ansel Adams, select the city package.
